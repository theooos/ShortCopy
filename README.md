# ShortCopy
Copies the URL of the current page you are on, and automatically shortens it using is.gd.
For those kinds of people, like myself, who are sickened when they're sent a 200 character URL.

### is.gd
Have now switched from goo.gl to is.gd due the fact that they don't require any access tokens and their API is super simple.

### Usage
The key command to activate this is Alt+Shift+C.

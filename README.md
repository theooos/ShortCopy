# ShortCopy
Copies the URL of the current page you are on, and automatically shortens it using goo.gl.
For those kinds of people, like myself, who are sickened when they're sent a 200 character URL.

### Goo.gl
Uses goo.gl to convert URLs. You will have to provide your own API access token for it to work however.

### Usage
The key command to activate this is Alt+Shift+C.

## Known bugs
* Connection times out with gapi and hence extension breaks. Will look into fixing this post exams.
